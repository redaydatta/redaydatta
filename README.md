Hi there, 

I’m Reday Datta. I’m a Professional Web and Software Developer. I've more than 3 years of experience and completed 30+ projects with full client satisfaction. I am skilled in Laravel, Lumen, PHP, MySQL, Livewire, React, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and so on. I always like to work honestly and work hard to the best of my ability to ensure the satisfaction of my clients. I also worked a remote job as a Software and Web Developer. Now I am working as an Associate Software Engineer at SSL Wireless.

Thank you!
